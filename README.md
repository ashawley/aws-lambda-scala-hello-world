## AWS Lambda Scala Hello World

The smallest example of using Scala with AWS Lambda.

Create a build.sbt with the following:

```scala
scalaVersion  := "2.12.0-RC1"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.amazonaws" % "aws-lambda-java-core" % "1.1.0"
)
```

Create source file, `Main.scala`, that writes to standard out, and
returns a result.

```scala
package example

import scala.collection.JavaConverters._

object Main extends LambdaApp  {

  def handler()  = {

    println("Hello Cloudwatch")

    List("Hello Lambda").toSeq.asJava
  }
}
```

The `LambdaApp` trait is defined to enforce the type signature for AWS
Lambda functions.  It can also help with testing the function locally.

```
> run
[info] Running com.middil.Main 
Hello Cloudwatch
Hello Lambda
```

To run on AWS, run the task provided by
[SBT Assembly](http://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly),

```
